# Dashboard Layout

This is how the dashboard looks like once you login and start the game. The Dashboard can be further divided into two parts for easy understanding.

We have divided the dashboard into two parts for easy understanding&#x20;



1. <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Top Bar**</mark> - Highlighted by blue, mainly focuses on informative content which is personal to the user. Example would be changing your name or password or checking notifications.
2. <mark style="background-color:red;">**Left Bar**</mark> - Highlighted by red, used for administrative purposes. Example would be importing students or creating classes with lesson plans.
