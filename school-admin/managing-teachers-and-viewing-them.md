# Managing Teachers/Professors and Viewing them

### Point to know - Adding or removing Teachers/Professors will not affect the Licenses. Teachers/Professors and School admins can use the game for free, they won't take up any licenses. Only students will take up licenses.&#x20;



Once on home page, you can scroll down to see the Teachers/Professors section under School Management and Data.&#x20;

First click on the red button which will download a sample excel sheet like this -

This is how the sample excel sheet will look like, as you can see there are 6 columns Firstname, Lastname, Age, Gender, e-mail and Designation. For reference we have already added information of two Teachers/Professors. All you have to do is fill the information of the Teachers/Professors you wish to add to the game. Once you add their information, save this excel sheet.



### Step 2 -

Click on the Browse button which is highlighted by white colour just below the red button. After doing this a page like this will open up.

All you have to do is to select the Excel file in which you have filled the information about the Teachers/Professors. Once done, then click on the Save button situated below the browse button. You will get Teachers/Professor Import Successful Prompt.&#x20;

Now the Teachers/Professors who were in the list will recieve unique links on their e-mails, all they have to do is click those links and register themselves on realLives. Their e-mail would be the username. Their default password will be 'password' for logging in. Teachers/Professors are recommended to change their password by going to the My Account section in the top right corner.

You can view the Teachers/Professors by going to the view Teachers/Professors tab. Refer to the last slide below.&#x20;

### <mark style="background-color:red;">Note -</mark>&#x20;

Make sure you enter e-mails which have not been previously registered on realLives. If you enter e-mails which have already been registered, you will get such a prompt -&#x20;
