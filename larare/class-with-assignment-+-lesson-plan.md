# Class with Assignment + Lesson Plan

### <mark style="background-color:blue;">What are Classes with Global Citizenship Assignment?</mark>

A class with a global citizenship assignment that encompasses 14 subjects such as diseases, human geography, economics, and more is likely designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the interconnectedness of various global issues and the role of individuals as global citizens.

Overall, a class with such a diverse range of subjects aims to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and perspectives necessary to understand and address complex global challenges as informed and engaged citizens of the world.

Also, there are more than 240 parameters with respect to the 14 subjects.

### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Lesson Plan -</mark>&#x20;

**Lesson Plan is an additional feature which works on top of the classes.**

A lesson plan is a detailed outline or guide designed by educators to structure and organize a teaching session or class period. It typically includes objectives, instructional materials, activities, assessments, and timelines, aiming to facilitate effective teaching and learning. Lesson plans serve as roadmaps for teachers, helping them to deliver content in a structured and coherent manner while catering to the needs and abilities of their students.
