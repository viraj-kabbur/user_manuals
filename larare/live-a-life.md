# Live a Life

RealLives is a gamified simulation that brings home the challenge of life in its many splendors and complexities. In the simulation, you will test your mettle against the many unpredictable life conditions that occur in the course of a lifetime – from birth to death.

As a Teacher you can play the game and be born in any life you wish to, by simply clicking on the 'Live a Life' button. Play demo game below.

When you enter the simulation, you can choose your character attributes (such as country of birth, gender, etc) by clicking on the 'Design a New Life', or you can allow the simulation to randomly allocate the attributes (by directly clicking on 'Live a Life'). All the previous data of your previous lives can also be accessed here.

When you click on the circular ‘Age a Year’ button, you will advance in age and be updated with the latest life events that happen to you or your family. You will also need to take decisions in some life problems. (These events and life problems are calculated on the basis of statistically accurate data of the country that you are born in)

All such events are automatically added to your Life Journal, which is a summary of your life experience. You are encouraged to write your responses to these various events, and this will be added to your Life-Journal.

As you advance in age, you will be able to handle the 6 aspects of your life; Education, Career, Finance, Relationships, Residence, and Leisure - to create a satisfactory life experience for yourself.

At the end of your life in the game, you can take stock of your entire life. At this point RealLives provides several tools for reflecting on your experience.
