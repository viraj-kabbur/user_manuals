# My Gameplay Data

Comprehensive data about the lives you have played. Data is filtered in the following parameters and can be viewed by accessing the specific tab.

For example, if you played a life and were born in Indonesia. Eventually as you played along, you made different decisions because of different situations. Those decisions and the data associated with it will be visible in these sections. Let's say in a game, as a healthy male you were asked to donate blood and you did, then that will be shown in the Blood Donation section. Even if you donate blood in multiple lives, it will be shown with respect to the person you played as.
