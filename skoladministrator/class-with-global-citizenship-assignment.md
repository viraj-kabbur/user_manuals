Let's see the functionalities of a class one by one -

* Class Name - helps in ordering different classes and identifying them easily.
* End Date - gives a deadline to students to complete the assignment.
* Age Group - specifies which students are to be assigned based on their age.
* Class Description - can be used to give a brief understanding of what is to be done by the students.
* Only allocated students can be assigned, also the teacher can choose which students are to be added to the class. As seen in the example Linda and John are added but Student 1 hasn't been added to the class.
* Similarly, teachers can also be added to the class . In the page attached below, out of all the teachers, only Serena Matthews has been added.
