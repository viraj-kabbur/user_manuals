Functionalities of a class -

* Class Name - helps in ordering different classes and identifying them easily.
* End Date - gives a deadline to students to complete the assignment.
* Age Group - specifies which students to be assigned based on their age.
* Class Description - can be used to give a brief understanding of what is to be done by the students.
* Only allocated students can be assigned, also the Teacher/Professor can choose which students are to be added to the class. As seen in the example Linda and John are added but Student 1 hasn't been added to the class.
* Similarly, Teachers/Professors can also be added to the class. In the page attached below, out of all Teachers/Professors, only Serena Matthews has been added.

Once done with everything, the Teacher/Professor can click the button which says Create a Class (upon scrolling down) and thus a class will be created.
