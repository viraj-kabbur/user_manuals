* **Description:** In this class, students are born into a random country, offering them an unpredictable experience of life. This class type encourages students to compare and contrast their lives with others, fostering critical thinking and promoting diversity of perspective.
* **Purpose:** Best for promoting discussions on global diversity and enhancing empathy by placing students in unfamiliar life situations.
* **Action:** Click the **Create** button to start setting up your Random Life class.\


## **3. Editing Your Class Board in RealBoard  :-**&#x20;

After clicking **Create**, the **Edit Board** page allows you to customize and configure your class board by naming it and adding sections for students to engage with. Here’s how to use this page effectively

## Class Types in RealLives and Their Unique Features

While the overall process of creating a class in RealLives remains consistent—adding a board name, editing sections, and entering class details—the class type you choose introduces unique features that tailor the learning experience to different objectives. Let’s explore how each class type differs and what specific opportunities they offer -&#x20;

\
Note - Random Life was discussed above.

## **Specific Country**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled design(12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Description:** Teachers can select a specific country for all students to be born in. This is perfect for in-depth explorations of that country’s culture, economy, or societal issues. This class type supports a focused, deep dive into specific countries, ideal for geography, economics, or social studies lessons.
* **Purpose:** Ideal for lessons that require detailed exploration of a particular region.
* **Action:** Click the **Create** button to begin setting up your Specific Country class.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-04 172413.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the **Specific Country** class, teachers can select a specific country where all students will be born. This allows for focused exploration of that country’s culture, economy, and societal issues.

* **Choosing a Country:** After selecting **Specific Country** as the class type, use the dropdown menu to select the country for your students to be born in.

Apart from selecting a country, the rest of the class creation flow remains the same as the **Random Life** process. Please refer to the **Random Life** flow above for detailed steps on setting up class details, editing board sections, and adding students and teachers.



## **Life with SDG**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled design(14) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Description:** In this class, students choose a country but are tied to a specific **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)**, such as poverty, inequality, or climate action.
* **Purpose:** This is the most impactful class type for global citizenship, SDG-based learning, and encouraging solutions for global challenges.
* **Action:** Click the **Create** button to start designing your SDG-based class.\


<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-04 174720.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the **Life with SDG** class, the teacher selects one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to guide the focus of the class. After choosing a goal (e.g., **Climate Action**, **No Poverty**), students can:

* Select any country to live in.
* Explore how the chosen SDG affects life in different regions.
* Engage with global challenges in a structured yet flexible way.

Once the teacher sets the main SDG, students can further customize their experience by:

* Choosing specific subgoals related to the main SDG (e.g., access to healthcare under **Good Health and Well-Being**).
* Understanding how these challenges play out in various countries.

This class type combines real-world global issues with student freedom, allowing them to explore the impact of SDGs in different contexts. Rest of the class creation flow remains the same.





## **Assignments**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled design(13) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Description:** Custom assignments based on topics like economics, culture, history, or any subject of choice. Teachers can tailor the class experience by assigning specific objectives, allowing students to engage with RealLives based on curriculum needs.
* **Purpose:** Best for highly customizable learning experiences focused on specific curriculum requirements.
* **Action:** Click the **Create** button to begin setting up your Assignment class.

<div>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-04 175741.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-04 175747.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

For the **Assignments** class type, the process is as follows:

* **Step 1: Choosing a Subject:** The teacher starts by selecting a subject from the available categories (e.g., **Human Geography**, **Economics**, **Environment & Ecology**). This subject will form the basis of the assignment and guide the learning focus.
* **Step 2: Selecting an Assignment:** After selecting a subject, the teacher will choose a specific assignment from a list. These assignments are linked to particular countries based on the chosen subject (e.g., “Be born in a country with the largest population” or “Be born in a country with the lowest girl education”).
* **Step 3: Students' Experience:** Once the assignment is set, students will experience life in the country linked to the selected assignment, enabling them to explore the challenges and dynamics specific to that country.

This approach allows teachers to align assignments with learning objectives while offering students a focused, country-specific simulation. Rest of the class creation flow remains the same.
